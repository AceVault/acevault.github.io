# Empty Website Template - README
First of all I would like to give a huge shoutout to **[w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/)**!\
I recommend you check it out and recommend its use as informational source for all your website development needs.

#### How-To
The intended usage would be to press Ctrl+F and search for UPDATE_FOR_USE.\
Adjust this text according to whatever applies for your website and preferences.\
The current indentation and markup is the one I personally use, so you *can* differ from it.\
For me, however, it retains an extremely clear organization throughout the designing process.

#### Template contents
This startup template pack, or whatever you'd like to call it, comes with a structured, empty HTML page template. *(template.html)*\
This same template is also provided with comments/suggestions at almost every part of the template. *(template-comments.html)*\
There's some files with an explanation to a specific part, these are the .md files. *(BASETARGET, LANGUAGES and this one, README)*\
Other than that, there's a folder structure *(./css/ and ./img/)* basic pages, with only the correct navigation links *(index.html, news.html, contact.html and about.html)* and a css file with the bare minimum. *(./css/default.css)*\
Lastly, there's a robots.txt, about which you'll read more at the SEO part.

#### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
**sitemap:** You can find a guide to sitemapping **[here](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668)**.\
**minification:** Apply minification to all CSS & JS files, which is easy with **[this tool](https://www.minifier.org/)**.\
**robots.txt** One has been included, but the current file is set to allow all web robots.\
Please visit **[this](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html)** website if you wish to change the robots.txt file to your preferences.\
**alt attribute:** Always add alt="example" to images.\
**meta attributes:** There's some guidelines to perfecting your meta attributes, which I won't go into now.\
As long as you include all of them, you're already ahead of most websites.\
**caching:** Could write a lot here, but I'll just provide you with **[this tool](https://sourceforge.net/projects/quickcache/).**\
**image expires:** Documentation on this can be found **[here](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/009272.html).**\
**Google Analytics:** Register an account **[here](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/)** and add your id in the script that's in your index.html.

#### Legal
No copyright whatsoever. Free to use, copy, share, edit or even steal, if that'd make you feel good.\
I would really appreciate it nonetheless if below the entire page, you could add this:
```html
<!-- Thanks DeveloPerry for providing a well-structured startup template. -->
```
That'd be all.
